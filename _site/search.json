Next, I studied the trends in name usage for Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul to see what trends those names followed from 1920 - 2000.

What trends do you notice?\nThe biggest thing I noticed right off the bat is that the name ‘Mary’ has by far the highest usage from 1920 all the way until 1968 where we see ‘Paul’ overtake. ‘Mary’ then makes a ressurgance in between 1988 and 1989 and becomes, once again, the most used name on through 2000. ‘Paul’, throughout the years is always higher in usage than both ‘Martha’ and ‘Peter’ and only being supassed by ‘Mary’ for the majority of the time. ‘Martha’ stays above ‘Peter’ and below ‘Paul’ from 1920 till 1953 where it dips below ‘Peter’ securing it’s spot as the least used name of the bunch overall. ‘Peter’ starts off as the lowest used name from 1920 until 1953 where it surpasses ‘Martha’. From then on it remains above ‘Martha’ and becomes the second lowest used name overall. Something interesting to note is that in all of the names, I noticed the beginning of an upward trend in all of them around 1936 with ‘Peter’ and ‘Paul’ being the only ones that started the upward trend a few years earlier. We also see a drastic fall for ‘Mary’, ‘Paul’, and ‘Peter’ between the years of 1950 and 1976. ‘Martha’, for whatever reason, started this trend earlier in 1952.\n\n\nRead and format data\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv\").query(\"name in ['Peter','Paul','Mary','Martha'] & year &gt;= 1920 & year &lt;=2000\")\n\n\n::: {#cell-Q3 chart .cell execution_count=8}\n\nplot example\nchart = px.line(df.head(1000),\n    x=\"year\", \n    y=\"Total\",\n    color=\"name\",\n    title=\"Historical Usage of 'Mary', 'Martha', 'Peter', and 'Paul'\"\n)\nchart.add_annotation(x=1950, y=53791,\n    text=\"Peak of Usage: Mary\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1)\n\nchart.add_annotation(x=1954, y=25662.5,\n    text=\"Peak of Usage: Paul\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1)\n\nchart.add_annotation(x=1947, y=10651,\n    text=\"Peak of Usage: Martha\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1)\n\nchart.add_annotation(x=1956, y=11321,\n    text=\"Peak of Usage: Peter\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1)\n\nchart.add_annotation(x=2000, y=6184,\n    text=\"Lowest Usage: Mary\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1)\n\nchart.add_annotation(x=2000, y=3786,\n    text=\"Lowest Usage: Paul\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1)\n\nchart.add_annotation(x=1932, y=2694.5,\n    text=\"Lowest Usage: Peter\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1)\n\nchart.add_annotation(x=1999, y=693,\n    text=\"Lowest Usage: Martha\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1)\nchart.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n:::",

Does it look like the movie had an effect on usage?\n_I decided to plot the usages of four names: Flynn, Tony, Elsa, and Jack. These are the names of the main characters in Tangled, Pirates of the Caribbean, Frozen, and Iron-Man respectively. I plotted them so I could see if there was any correltion between usage, and the years those movies were released. From what I could see from the data, There was a sharp rise in usage of the name Jack a year after the Pirates movie came out. This one is tough because it seems like there wasn’t a sharp increase in usage until about a year after it came out. I could attribute the usage spike to the movie’s release but I’m not 100% sure. With Elsa, and Flynn, We see a sharp spike in usage after their movies were released suggesting that the movies did cause that spike. As for Tony, we actually see a downward trend start a few years before the Iron-Man movie released. It is hard to determine wether the movie had a significant impact on that name’s usage.\n\n\nRead and format data\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv\").query(\"name in ['Flynn','Jack','Elsa','Tony']\")\n\n\n::: {#cell-Q4 chart .cell execution_count=10}\n\nplot example\nchart = px.line(df.head(1000),\n    x=\"year\", \n    y=\"Total\",\n    color=\"name\",\n    title=\"Historical Usage of 'Flynn', 'Jack', 'Elsa', and 'Tony'\"\n)\n\nchart.add_annotation(x=2003, y=9316,\n    text=\"Pirates of the Caribbean released\", #|We see a 232 usage increase from 2003 to 2004 after pirates 1.
